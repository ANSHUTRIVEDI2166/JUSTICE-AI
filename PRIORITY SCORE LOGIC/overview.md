# Justice-AI: Priority Scoring System

This notebook implements a custom priority scoring algorithm for legal cases based on factors like:

- Case type (Rape, Kidnapping, Murder, etc.)
- Case status (Pending, Under Trial)
- Media attention
- Evidence availability
- Urgency level
- Number of victims
- Severity
- Filing date

Cases are scored and sorted to identify the ones that should be prioritized for faster resolution.

ðŸ“Œ Focus: Logic-based scoring system (no model training or visualizations in this notebook).
